In the powerpoint slide show, the main functions and advantages of this webapp is illustrated in a easy-to-understand fashion.
To try the webapp, run the file "server.py".
To make sure the app works normally, please enter your email when the chat app asks for your nickname.
To enable multi-user interaction, make sure the users are all on the same server (linked to the same IP address).
Have fun.
